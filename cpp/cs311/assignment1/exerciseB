Exercise B - General Questions

Answer each of the following questions.

   1. What is "information hidingâ", and what is an advantage of using it?


information hiding is 

       
   2. Write reasonable pre- and postconditions for the following function, which does a speed computation:

          // calcSpeed
          // pre:
          //  dist >= 0
          //  time > 0
          // post: returns the speed (dist / time)
          double calcSpeed(double dist, double time)
          {
              return dist / time;
          }


       
   3. Write reasonable class invariants for the following class, which holds a array of data.

          // class invariants:
          // 0 <= n_ <= however big size_t is
          // arr_ points to enough allocated memory for n_ ints
          class MyArray {

             // Member function declarations go here

          private:
              int * arr_;  // pointer to array
              size_t n_;   // size of array
          };


       
   4. The following code (for finding the area of a circle) compiles and produces correct answers. However, it is both poorly designed and poorly written.

          double a(double&r)
          {
              double v=3.1415926535897932384626433832795*r*r;return v;
          }

      Find three problems with this code, and indicate how you would fix them.

1. PI as a magic number should be moved to a constant
2. function should have a meaningful name
3. no need for pass by reference, use pass by value

const double PI = 3.1415926535897932384626433832795;
double areaOfCircle(double r) {
  return PI*r*r;
}
