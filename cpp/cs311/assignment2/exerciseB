Exercise B - General Questions

Answer each of the following questions.

   1.  
         1. When we declare a copy constructor in C++, what other functions do we probably need to declare?

Copy Assignment, and Destructor

         2. Under what circumstances do we usually need to declare these functions?

when a class is RAII (we are managing a resource like dynamicly allocated memory, open files, etc, etc)

       
   2. Below is part of a C++ class definition:

          // Class Emu
          // Invariants:
          //    p_ points to valid allocated memory and
          //    is owned by *this
          class Emu {
          public:
              ~Emu()
              { delete p_; }

              [Other functions go here]

          private:
              unsigned long * p_;
          };

      Write reasonable class invariants for class Emu. Hint: Remember that ownership is a class invariant.
       
   3.  
         1. What is the key feature of a class that implements RAII? Hint: One of its member functions does something.
the destructor, that deallocates memory automatically, so that it doesn't get forgotten

         2. How does RAII make C++ programming "safer"?
RAII prevents resource leaks


       
   4.  
         1. In the context of this class, what is a container?
A container is a data structure that can contain multiple items

         2. Give two examples of containers available in standard C++ (built into the language or part of the Standard Library).
vector, deque
