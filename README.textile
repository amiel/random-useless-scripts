h1. Random Useless Scripts

Here you will find some scripts / programs that I have written to help myself understand a language or concept.

In addition, there are some scripts that I may not have written. I have tried to note that wherever possible.

These are mostly organized by language.

I do have some homework assignments here. If you are a CS student, you are welcome to read them to get ideas, but DO NOT COPY. After all, how do you know whether I got a good grade?
